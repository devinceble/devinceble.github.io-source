Been coding for a while and making a drawer feature on both
IOS and Android.

It's been awhile when I'm pump up doing code and design.

Doing both UX at the same time is a bit more work cause
it may not work on both platforms. I'm following both standards
and work my way on a mixed standard cause it fells more suitable
for both platform.

More tickets to solve for the business feature of our Application
and sprint 1 of our weekly sprints is done but its 80% done.
having our designers pump up to redesign something if it does not fit the UX.

Now back to hacking and coding.
