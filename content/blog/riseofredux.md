The thing is redux is complex but simple.

Now will start coding with redux inside react native. its my first time to use actions store and reducers so it might be challenging at first.

The first thing is go to http://redux.js.org all examples might be on react.js only not on react-native but it will also work in native.
My first fight with this style or framework of coding is it makes things complex how in the world can I use this on my advantage...

Hey I'm working on projects I will continue blugging-> "blog with a bug" about redux when I'm done.

:vimwarrior out:wq!
